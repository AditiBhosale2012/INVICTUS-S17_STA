      answer: 'Initially, sanitary napkins were made of cotton-based absorbent bound by gauge and a waterproof lining. These evolved into ultra-thin synthetic sanitary napkins which use Super Absorbent Polymer (SAP) with Polyethylene back. SAP is a petroleum-based product that can absorb liquids many times its weight and convert into gel. SAP is added to a compressed cotton absorbent core to increase its absorption capacity.',
